# Snap.FreeTransform

Adaptation of [Raphael.FreeTransform](https://github.com/ElbertF/Raphael.FreeTransform) plugin for [Snap](http://snapsvg.io/). This is a fork with a few adjustments.
Provides a free transform tool to move, rotate and scale elements.

## TODO
- split into chunks for easier maintenance and testing
- leverage groups; remove reliance on `toFront()` / `toBack()`
- test suite; write tests
